# XlightSmartController
XlightSmartController is an IoT near-end component, which works between IoT cloud and IoT end-point devices. In other words, XlightSmartController can be considered as a gateway or smart HUB. For instance, a smart home may need one XlightSmartController, and a couple of smart fixtures, remote controls, Apps, as well as other supported devices.  

XlightSmartController is now based on Particle Photon & P1 MCU, and works with Particle public or private cloud.  

At present, XlightSmartController has these main features:
* Three communication methods: Wi-Fi, RF2.4 and BLE  
* Four sensors: temperature & humidity (DHT), photoresistor (ALS), motion detector (PIR) and microphone  
* Supports rules, schedules, alarms and scenarios  
* Interfaces include cloud API, RF2.4 protocol, and serial port console  

This repository contains the software package of XlightSmartController, while the hardware design will be added as its sibling project soon.
